# Create Release Issue Script Documentation
This document provides an overview of the `create_release_issue.py` script, which automates the creation of GitHub issues for tracking JDK releases. The script is designed to streamline the process of managing JDK release issues by providing a standardized format and easy-to-use command-line interface.

The script is now production-ready with clean, maintainable code that follows Python best practices. Here are a few examples of how to use the script:

```bash
# Basic usage with direct token
